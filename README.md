Next Word Prediction using LSTM

Built a next-word prediction model using an LSTM neural network trained on The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes text dataset.
The project preprocesses raw text using tokenization, sequence generation, and padding,
then trains a deep learning model to predict the next word in a sentence and generate text from seed inputs.
